	Applies a Krauss map to a density matrix $\nho$. The Krauss map consists in some number of operators
	satisfying $\sum_{i} \hat{K}_{i}^{\dagger}\hat{K}_{i} = \hat{I}$. $\rho$ is transformed via:

	$$\rho \rightarrow \sum_{i} \hat{K}_{i}\rho\hat{K}_{i}^{\dagger} $$

def partial_trace_krauss(keep, dims):
    r"""
    Constructs the Krauss map corresponding to the partial trace. Takes `keep` which is a single index or list of indices denoting
    subsystems to keep, and a list `dims` of dimensions of the overall tensor product Hilbert space.

    For illustration, to trace over the $i^{th}$ subsystem of $n$, one would construct Krauss operators:

    $$ \hat{K}_{i} = I^{\otimes i - 1} \otimes \langle i \mid \otimes I^{\otimes n - i}$$.

def povm_map(krauss, A, B=None):

    Represents a Krauss map on Qbist probability vectors. Takes a list of Krauss operators, a POVM $A$ on the initial Hilbert space,
    and a POVM $B$ on the final Hilbert space. If $B$ isn't provided, it's assumed to be the same as $A$. Then the matrix elements of the map are:

    $$K_{j, i} = tr( \mathbb{K}(\frac{\hat{A}_{i}}{tr \hat{A}_{i}})\hat{B}_{j} ) $$

    Where $\mathbb{K}(\hat{O})$ denotes the Krauss map applied to $O$.
